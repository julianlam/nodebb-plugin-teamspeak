This plugin for NodeBB allows people to put a configurable widget on their website which shows their Teamspeak server's details.

Installation:

    npm install nodebb-plugin-teamspeak

All one must do is, in the NodeBB Admin area, go to Themes > Widgets, drag the widget wherever they want, and configure the options for the widget.

This plugin also allows for low and high-level automation of the Teamspeak server. These automation features can be set up via the plugin's settings page in the admin area.
